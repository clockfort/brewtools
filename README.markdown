Brewtools
=========

A set of tools helpful to brewing your own beverages. Most all of the utilities apply to making beer, but several are generic enough to apply to making your own wine, soda, cider, etc.

Utilities
---------

* calc-alcohol-content.pl calculates the alcohol content of a beverage based on its specific gravity fermentation delta. It has code to accomodate for temperature variations. This temperature compensation code is for 60-deg F calibrated hydrometers, but I am led to believe this is by far the most prevalent hydrometer type.

* bottle-calculator.pl approximate the number of 12oz bottles that are required, based on the liquid's height and diameter of the fermenter or bottling bucket. (This assumes cylindrical fermenters/bottling buckets/etc, but again, this seems to be the case almost all of the time)
